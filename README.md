# Scientific Visualization Labs

This repository contains lab assignments completed as part of the **Scientific Visualization** course. These labs focus on implementing and experimenting with different visualization techniques to process and display scientific data effectively.

## Labs Overview

- **Lab 1: Basic Volume Rendering**
  - Implemented basic volume rendering techniques to visualize scalar fields using raycasting.

- **Lab 2: Isosurface Extraction with Marching Cubes**
  - Extracted isosurfaces from volumetric data using the Marching Cubes algorithm.

- **Lab 3: Vector Field Visualization**
  - Visualized vector fields using streamlines and glyphs to represent flow patterns.
